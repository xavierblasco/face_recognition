# face_recognition

Opencv project to detect and play with faces detection.

Add the charls chaplin hat and moustache over all faces detected. They are resized to adapt your face.

I have removed green rectangle from webcam capture, but code remains on source code but it's commented.

Also there are som alternative lbp cascades available on code.
